**InControl-Desktop — Data Handling & Security**

This document describes how InControl handles your data, what information is stored, and the security measures in place.

---

## Data Storage

Sessions, settings, and logs stay on this PC. InControl does not run an account service and it does not send telemetry.

The chat stays on this PC until you connect a rented GPU in **Where this chat runs**. That connection sends the conversation to Ollama on the machine you named. It is a different decision from the tool-URL allowlist. Disconnect, and the chat is local again.

### Storage Locations

| Data Type | Location | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Sessions | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\InControl\sessions\` | Conversation history and context |
| Logs | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\InControl\logs\` | Application logs for troubleshooting |
| Cache | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\InControl\cache\` | Temporary data and model caches |
| Config | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\InControl\config\` | User preferences and settings |
| Temp | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\InControl\temp\` | Temporary processing files |
| Support | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\InControl\support\` | Support bundles when exported |
| Exports | `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\InControl\exports\` | User-exported data |

### What Is Stored

- **Session Data**: Your conversation history, including messages you send and responses received from local AI models
- **Model Selections**: Which models you've chosen to use
- **UI Preferences**: Theme, layout, and display settings
- **Application Logs**: Operational logs (no message content by default)

### What Is NOT Stored

- No data is stored on external servers
- No telemetry is sent to Anthropic, Microsoft, or any third party
- No usage analytics are collected

---

## Network Activity

### Local Model Inference

InControl connects to **local inference backends** running on your machine:

| Backend | Default Address | Purpose |
|---------|-----------------|---------|
| llama.cpp | `http://localhost:8080` | Local LLM inference |
| Ollama | `http://localhost:11434` | Local LLM inference |

These connections are:
- **Localhost only** by default
- **Configurable** for custom setups
- **No external network calls** unless you explicitly configure a remote endpoint

### What InControl Does NOT Do

- Does not phone home
- Does not check for updates automatically (manual check only)
- Does not send crash reports without explicit user action
- Does not send the chat to a rental unless you connect one in **Where this chat runs**

---

## Secrets Policy

### No Secrets in Logs

InControl is designed to **never log sensitive information**:

- API keys are never written to logs
- Tokens and credentials are never logged
- Session content is not logged (only metadata)

### Secure Storage

Any sensitive configuration (if applicable) uses:
- Windows Credential Manager for secure credential storage
- File system permissions appropriate for user data

### Support Bundles

When you export a support bundle:
- **Included**: Version info, runtime info, log files, sanitized config
- **Excluded**: Session content, API keys, tokens, credentials
- **User-Approved Only**: Session metadata is only included with explicit opt-in

---

## Data Retention

### Automatic Cleanup

- **Logs**: Rolling file system with size caps (default: 10MB per file, 5 files max)
- **Cache**: Automatic cleanup of stale cache entries
- **Temp**: Cleaned on application startup

### User Control

You have full control over your data:
- **Export**: Export sessions to JSON or Markdown anytime
- **Delete**: Delete individual sessions or all data
- **Reset**: Full application reset with export-first prompt

---

## Write Boundaries

InControl enforces strict write boundaries:

### Allowed Write Locations

- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\InControl\*` - Application data
- `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\InControl\exports\*` - User exports

### Forbidden Write Locations

InControl will **never** write to:
- System directories (`C:\Windows\*`)
- Program Files (`C:\Program Files\*`)
- Other users' directories
- Any location outside the allowed roots

---

## Dependency Security

### Vulnerability Scanning

Dependencies are scanned for known vulnerabilities:
- Run `dotnet list package --vulnerable` to check
- Security advisories are monitored for critical packages

### Key Dependencies

| Package | Purpose | Security Notes |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK | UI framework | Microsoft-maintained |
| LLamaSharp | Local inference | Open source |
| System.Text.Json | Serialization | .NET BCL |

---

## Threat Model

### In Scope

- Local data confidentiality
- Protection against data exfiltration
- Secure handling of model outputs

### Out of Scope

- Physical access attacks
- Compromised operating system
- Malicious local inference backends

---

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to the maintainers privately
3. Include steps to reproduce if possible

---

## Compliance Notes

- **No account, no telemetry.** InControl does not collect an account or a usage stream.
- **A connected rental receives the chat you send.** That machine is yours to account for. The app's copy names it while the tunnel is up.
- **Export.** You can export session data from this PC.
